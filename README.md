# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Add form allowing users to submit list of menu items they liked
- Add additional logic to the above form to allow users to submit items they didn't like
- Add 'Careers' tab in the event someone wants to apply for a position
- Add ability to order in advance (this could prove advantageous during rush hours)
